# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Shopify + Sanity JS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# About

This is the fully functional eCommerce / Artist Website for Adam Finkelston that uses Next.js + Tailwind CSS in the front end and leverages the Shopify Storefront API to interact with your Shopify backend and uses Sanity to upload content. You can see a Live Demo [here](https://fink-seano424.vercel.app/ "Adam Finkelston's Shopify / Art Site").

We use GraphQL to query our Shopify data and store the cart information in localStorage to persist user session. Finally - we use Shopify Checkout to let the user
purchase the items. The store is functional and you can buy the artwork. :smiley:
